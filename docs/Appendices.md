##### Home Page:

<img src="../static/img/home_page.png" alt="Home Page" width="500"/>

Here is the home page, it has a drop down menu with all the modes, a begin button, an exit button and an options page.

##### Options Page:

<img src="../static/img/optionsPage.png" alt="Options Page" width="500"/>  
<img src="../static/img/savedFileOptions.png" alt="Saved File Options" width="500"/>

In the options page, you can select whether or not the camera is displayed on screen on startup and can change the location to where the counts are saved.

##### HandsUp!:

Our first mode is counting the number of hands that are raised in a frame.

For example, a teacher could ask students to raise their hands if they like dogs, and the students would answer accordingly. 

##### Cards Raised:

The second mode is to count the cards that are being held up by students.

The teacher can select the correct answer by ticking the box. This will reflect in the saved answers file.

Once the students are holding up their cards, the teacher has the option to freeze the frame and counts by pressing the space bar, this holds the counts in place to give the teacher ample time to save the current counts to a text file in the selected location if they want to.

After saving it, the teacher can press space bar again to unfreeze the camera and move to the next question.

##### TableTop Mode:

The third mode is the tabletop mode, this is intended for users with limited mobility as it allows students to interact with card counting without raising the cards.

<img src="../static/img/tableTop1.png" alt="TableTop1" width="500"/>  
<img src="../static/img/tableTop2.png" alt="TableTop2" width="500"/>

Users simply need to move their hands near the card in order for it to appear in the counts as seen in the images above.

##### Cumulative Card Counting:

This is intended for classes that cannot fit the entire room in one frame or for groups of students that answer at varied times.

The teacher can hit the space bar to freeze the frame and hold the counts of the first set of students.  

They can then hit the space bar again to unfreeze the frame and ask the next set of students to hold their cards up.

Card counts are accumulated and not erased upon unfreezing in this mode. Once the teacher is satisfied with the number of answers they can save the answers and press the enter key to reset the counter before moving to the next question.

##### Viewing Saved Files:

To view the saved files, open the location in which you selected earlier and find the text file.

<img src="../static/img/savedFileLocation.png" alt="Saved File Location" width="500"/>  
<img src="../static/img/savedFile.png" alt="Saved File" width="500"/>


The file contains the timestamp of the question, the counts and the correct answer (if specified).
